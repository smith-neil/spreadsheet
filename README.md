Spreadsheet
===========

A simple spreadsheet in the browser.

Create a div with id 'spreadSheet' and include spreadSheet.js.

Optionally, before you include spreadSheet.js, you can set a configuration object to control the row and column count:

    var spreadSheet = {
      rows: 20,
      cols: 20
    }

The object must be named 'spreadSheet'. If a config object is not provided, the row and column count will default to 10.
